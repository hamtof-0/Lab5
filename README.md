Collaborative labboration task 5 for the course D0010E

This repository is/was used for collaborating on a task given in the D0010E course from LTU Sweden.
The purpose of this task is to code a simulator that will (very crudely) simulate a convenience store and
print the output containing the values from the simulation to the console running it.
